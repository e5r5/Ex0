# Ex1=shortest path with black list nodes in G(V,E)

 It implements the Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm over Directed Graph.
 Run with Array of link list.
 Run on O(nember of black list node *E * logV) 
 test with Graph with 1 M nodes and 15 M eage
 
 Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.
The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.
